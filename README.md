# SMBFinder: Your Guide to Smarter Business Location Choices

## Summary

`SMBFinder` (Smart Microbusiness Finder) is a data-driven dashboard designed to help entrepreneurs and microbusiness owners identify optimal locations to start their business across the United States. Users can visualize microbusiness density through a heatmap, filter data by state and county, and analyze historical trends in microbusiness growth and workforce availability. The dashboard provides insights into competition levels, median income trends, and other key business indicators. Users can leverage these insights to make informed decisions, reduce risks, and strategically expand their business in the most promising locations.

## What are we doing?

### The Problem

Starting a microbusiness can be challenging due to the lack of accessible, data-driven insights about location suitability. Entrepreneurs often struggle to find the best places to start or expand their business based on competition levels, economic conditions, and workforce availability.

### The Solution

SMBFinder provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to:

- Explore microbusiness density over time. 
- Identify high-potential locations through heatmaps.
- Analyze trends across different economic and demographic indicators.

By providing a structured data-driven approach, SMBFinder helps business owners, policymakers, and investors understand key trends and make informed choices about where to establish or grow their businesses.
